    "date": "Mexico City - May 27, 2025",
    "leadParagraph": "FOLKS, what I'm about to tell you will shock you to your very core! In yet ANOTHER example of Hollywood's reckless disregard for public safety, a massive Pacific Rim movie prop has caused absolute CHAOS at the prestigious Museo Soumaya in Mexico City!",

      "This reporter has learned that during what was supposed to be a \"sophisticated cultural exhibition\" organized by none other than Guillermo del Toro himself, a GIGANTIC robot prop - standing over 30 FEET TALL - came crashing down like a house of cards! And who was the innocent victim of this Hollywood negligence? A sweet, defenseless child clutching nothing but a innocent Godzilla plushie!",
      "\"It was absolute pandemonium!\" reported witness Maria Gonzalez. \"One moment the child was admiring the display, hugging their little Godzilla toy, and the next moment - CRASH! This massive metal monster comes tumbling down!\"",
      "But here's the REAL kicker, folks - where was the so-called \"friendly neighborhood\" Spider-Man during all this? NOWHERE TO BE FOUND! While innocent children are being terrorized by Hollywood's mechanical monstrosities, our web-slinging menace is probably off taking selfies or whatever it is masked vigilantes do these days!",
      "The child, thankfully, suffered only minor injuries and refused to let go of their Godzilla plushie throughout the entire ordeal. \"At least someone knows how to hold onto what's important,\" I say! Unlike certain WALL-CRAWLING MENACES who can't even show up when the city ACTUALLY needs them!",
      "Del Toro's exhibition, which was meant to showcase the \"artistry of monster cinema,\" has been temporarily closed pending a full investigation. This reporter demands answers: How many more children must suffer before Hollywood learns to keep their oversized toys PROPERLY SECURED?"
    ],
    "closingStatement": "Mark my words - if Spider-Man had been doing his job instead of gallivanting around in that ridiculous costume, this NEVER would have happened! The real monsters aren't in the movies, folks - they're swinging through our streets!",
    "editorNote": "EDITOR'S NOTE: The Daily Bugle continues its ongoing investigation into Spider-Man's whereabouts during this crisis. Any information regarding the wall-crawler's negligence should be reported immediately.",
